Project Title: Stock market price prediction using machine learning

Objective: To develop a machine learning-based system that predicts future stock prices using historical data and visualizes stock performance trends.

Problem Statement:-
Stock prices are highly volatile and influenced by multiple factors such as news, economy, company performance, and market trends and predicting them manually is difficult. 
This project aims to use machine learning models (like Linear Regression, LSTM, or Random Forest) to predict the next-day closing price of a stock based on its historical data.


Programming Language: Python

Libraries:
pandas, numpy – data processing
matplotlib, seaborn – data visualization
scikit-learn – ML algorithms
keras / tensorflow – for deep learning (optional)
yfinance or alpha_vantage – to fetch real stock data

Database (optional): MySQL or SQLite
Frontend (optional): Streamlit / Flask web interface

Methodology(steps):

Step1: Data collection : Fetch historical stock prices (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume)

Step2: Data preprocessing:-
(i) Handle missing values
(ii) Normalize Scale
(iii) Convert dates and set as index

Step3: Feature Scaling:-
(i) Create additional features (like moving average, RSI, etc)
(ii) Split dataset into training and testing sets

Step4: Model Selection
(i) Start with Linear Regression/ Random Forest for baseling


Step5: Model Training and Testing
(i) Train model using historical data 
(ii) Evaluate using metrices like MSE, RMSE, R2 score, etc

Step6: Prediction and Visualization
(i) Predicts future stock prices
(ii) Plot actual vs predicted prices
(iii) Display with a sample(like streamlit dashboard)

step7: Compare models and discuss accuracy and timelines
